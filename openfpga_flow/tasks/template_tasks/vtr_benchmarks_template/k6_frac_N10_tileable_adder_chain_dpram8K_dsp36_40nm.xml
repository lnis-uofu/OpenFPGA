  Flagship Heterogeneous Architecture with Carry Chains for VTR 7.0.

  - 40 nm technology
  - General purpose logic block: 
    K = 6, N = 10, fracturable 6 LUTs (can operate as one 6-LUT or two 5-LUTs with 8 total FLE inputs (2 inputs of which are shared by the 5-LUTs) 
    with optionally registered outputs
    Each 5-LUT has an arithemtic mode that converts it to a single-bit adder with both inputs driven by 4-LUTs (both 4-LUTs share all 4 inputs)
    Carry chain links to vertically adjacent logic blocks
  - Memory size 32 Kbits, memory aspect ratios vary from a data width of 1 to data width of 64.  
    Height = 6, found on every (8n+2)th column
  - Multiplier modes: one 36x36, two 18x18, each 18x18 can also operate as two 9x9.  
    Height = 4, found on every (8n+6)th column
  - Routing architecture: L = 4, fc_in = 0.15, Fc_out = 0.1

  Details on Modelling:

  The electrical design of the architecture described here is NOT from an 
  optimized, SPICED architecture.  Instead, we attempt to create a reasonable 
  architecture file by using an existing commercial FPGA to approximate the area, 
  delay, and power of the underlying components. This is combined with a reasonable 40 nm 
  model of wiring and circuit design for low-level routing components, where available.
  The resulting architecture has delays that roughly match a commercial 40 nm FPGA, but also 
  has wiring electrical parameters that allow the wire lengths and switch patterns to be 
  modified and you will still get reasonable delay results for the new architecture.
  The following describes, in detail, how we obtained the various electrical values for this 
  architecture.

  Rmin for nmos and pmos, routing buffer sizes, and I/O pad delays are from the ifar 
  architecture created by Ian Kuon: K06 N10 45nm fc 0.15 area-delay optimized architecture. 
  (n10k06l04.fc15.area1delay1.cmos45nm.bptm.cmos45nm.xml)      
  This routing architecture was optimized for 45 nm, and we have scaled it linearly to 40 nm to 
  match the overall target (a 40 nm FPGA).

  We obtain delay numbers by measuring delays of routing, soft logic blocks, 
  memories, and multipliers from test circuits on a Stratix IV GX device 
  (EP4SGX230DF29C2X, i.e. fastest speed grade). For routing, we took the average delay of H4 and V4 
  wires.  Rmetal and Cmetal values for the routing wires were obtained from work done by Charles 
  Chiasson. We use a 96 nm half-pitch (corresponding to mid-level metal stack 40 nm routing) and 
  take the R and C data from the ITRS roadmap.  

  For the general purpose logic block, we assume that the area and delays of the Stratix IV 
  crossbar is close enough to the crossbar modelled here.  
  Stratix IV uses 52 inputs and 20 feedback lines, but only a half-populated crossbar, leading to 
  36:1 multiplexers.  We match these parameters in this architecture.

  For LUTs, we include LUT 
  delays measured from Stratix IV which is dependant on the input used (ie. some 
  LUT inputs are faster than others).  The CAD tools at the time of VTR 7 does 
  not consider differences in LUT input delays.

  Adder delays obtained as approximate values from a Stratix IV EP4SE230F29C3 device.  
  Delay obtained by compiling a 256 bit adder (registered inputs and outputs, 
  all pins except clock virtual) then measuring the delays in chip-planner, 
  sumout delay = 0.271ns to 0.348 ns, intra-block carry delay = 0.011 ns, 
  inter-block carry delay = 0.327 ns.  Given this data, I will approximate 
  sumout 0.3 ns, intra-block carry-delay = 0.01 ns, and 
  inter-block carry-delay = 0.16 ns (since Altera inter-block carry delay has 
  overhead that we don't have, I'll approximate the delay of a simpler chain at 
  one half what they have.  This is very rough, anything from 0.01ns to 0.327ns 
  can be justified).

  Logic block area numbers obtained by scaling overall tile area of a 65nm 
  Stratix III device, (as given in Wong, Betz and Rose, FPGA 2011) to 40 nm, then subtracting out 
  routing area at a channel width of 300. We use a channel width of 300 because it can route 
  all the VTR 6.0 benchmark circuits with an approximately 20% safety margin, and is also close to the
  total channel width of Stratix IV. Hence this channel width is close to the commercial practice of
  choosing a width that provides high routability. The architecture can be routed at different channel
  widths, but we estimate the tile size and hence the physical length of routing wires assuming
  a channel width of 300.

  Sanity checks employed:
    1.  We confirmed the routing buffer delay is ~1/3rd of total routing delay at L = 4. This matches 
        common electrical design.

      <!--- Area calculation: Total Stratix IV tile area is about 8100 um^2, and a minimum width transistor 
	   area is 60 L^2 yields a tile area of 84375 MWTAs.
	   Routing at W=300 is 30481 MWTAs, leaving us with a total of 53000 MWTAs for logic block area 
	   This means that only 37% of our area is in the general routing, and 63% is inside the logic
	   block. Note that the crossbar / local interconnect is considered part of the logic block
	   area in this analysis. That is a lower proportion of of routing area than most academics
	   assume, but note that the total routing area really includes the crossbar, which would push
	   routing area up significantly, we estimate into the ~70% range.
