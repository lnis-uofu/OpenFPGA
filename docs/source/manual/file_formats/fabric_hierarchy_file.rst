Fabric Hierarchy File (.yaml)
----------------------------------------

This file is generated by command :ref:`openfpga_setup_commands_write_fabric_hierarchy`


The fabric hierarchy file aims to show module trees of a number of given roots

This file is created for netlist manipulation and detailed floorplanning during physical design steps

By using the options of the command :ref:`openfpga_setup_commands_write_fabric_hierarchy`, user can selectively output the module tree on their needs.

An example of the file is shown as follows.

.. code-block:: yaml

  fpga_top:
    tile_0__2_:
      sb_0__1_:
        mux_tree_tapbuf_size2:
          INVTX1
          const1
          tap_buf4
          mux_tree_tapbuf_basis_input2_mem1:
            - TGATE
        mux_tree_tapbuf_size2_feedthrough_mem
        sb_1__config_group_mem_size40:
          mux_tree_tapbuf_size2_mem:
            - DFF
    tile_1__2_:
      grid_io_top:
        logical_tile_io_mode_io_:
          logical_tile_io_mode_physical__iopad:
            - GPIO
            - GPIO_feedthrough_DFF_mem
          direct_interc

In this example, the root module is ``fpga_top``.
The child modules under ``fpga_top`` are ``tile_0__2_`` and ``tile_1__2_``.
Note that the leaf nodes are shown as a list, e.g., ``GPIO`` and ``GPIO_feedthrough_DFF_mem``.

When multiple root modules are defined, the output could be

.. code-block:: yaml

  sb_0__1_:
    - mux_tree_tapbuf_size2
  sb_1__0_:
    - mux_tree_tapbuf_size2
  sb_1__1_:
    - mux_tree_tapbuf_size2
  cbx_1__0_:
    - mux_tree_tapbuf_size4
  cbx_1__1_:
    - mux_tree_tapbuf_size4
  cby_0__1_:
    - mux_tree_tapbuf_size2
    - mux_tree_tapbuf_size4
  cby_1__1_:
    - mux_tree_tapbuf_size4
