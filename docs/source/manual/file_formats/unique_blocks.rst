Unique Blocks (.xml)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A unique blocks file is formatted in XML. The unique blocks can be of type ``cbx``, ``cby`` or ``sb``. As illustrated by the XML code below, the file includes the type and coordinates of these unique blocks, as well as the coordinates of their corresponding instances.

Configurable Block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unique blocks can be applied to various blocks, each of which can be of type ``cbx``, ``cby`` or ``sb``, and may have different coordinates.

.. option:: <block type="<string>" x="<string>" y="<string>"/>   

  For each block, a set of keys can be defined. For unique blocks, both keys and instances can be specified. However, if a unique block does not have an instance, only keys are permitted.
 
  - ``type`` specifies the type of the unique block. Valid values for ``type`` are ``cbx``, ``cby`` or ``sb``.

  - ``x`` represents the x-coordinate of the unique block.

  - ``y`` represents the y-coordinate of the unique block. 

Configurable Instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A specific unique block can have multiple instances, where each instance is a mirrored version of the unique block. Each instance shares the same type as its parent block and includes information about its coordinates.

.. option:: <instance x="<string>" y="<string>"/>

  - ``x`` specifies the x-coordinate of the instance. 

  - ``y`` specifies the y-coordinate of the instance. 


The following content provides an example of a unique block file:

.. code-block:: xml
  
  <unique_blocks>
  	<block type="sb" x="0" y="0">
  	</block>
  	<block type="sb" x="0" y="1">
  	</block>
  	<block type="sb" x="1" y="0">
  	</block>
  	<block type="sb" x="1" y="1">
  	</block>
  	<block type="cbx" x="1" y="0">
  		<instance x="0" y="0"/>
  		<instance x="0" y="1"/>
  	</block>
  	<block type="cbx" x="1" y="1">
  	</block>
  	<block type="cby" x="0" y="1">
  		<instance x="0" y="0"/>
  		<instance x="1" y="0"/>
  	</block>
  	<block type="cby" x="1" y="1">
  	</block>
  </unique_blocks>
